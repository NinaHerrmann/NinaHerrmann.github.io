Complex algorithms and enormous data sets require parallel execution of programs to
attain results in a reasonable amount of time. Both aspects are combined in the domain
of three-dimensional stencil operations, for example, computational fluid dynamics.
This work contributes to the research on high-level parallel programming by discussing
the generalizable implementation of a three-dimensional stencil skeleton that works in
heterogeneous computing environments. Two exemplary programs, a gas simulation
with the Lattice Boltzmann method, and a mean blur, are executed in a multi-node
multi-graphics processing units environment, proving the runtime improvements in
heterogeneous computing environments compared to a sequential program
