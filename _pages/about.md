I started studying information systems in 2014 as I kind of liked computer science (as far as one can know at this point in time). I continued with my master in 2017 and finished my PhD in 2024 at the <a href="https://www.wi.uni-muenster.de/de/institut/ehemalige-gruppen/pi">chair for practical computer science</a>. From 2016-2019 I worked as a student assistant at the <a href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/ZHL/digitalelehre/index.html">ZHLDigital</a>.
